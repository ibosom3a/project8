                <h3>BAN</h3>
                <p>In pan pizza, the bottom and side of the crust are fried with coated oil. Moreover, pan pizza has a thick crust full of extra cheese with a very crispy crust. Generally, we use bake pan pizza at a higher temperature for about fifteen minutes. Also, to get the shape, the dough of the pan pizza is spread in a pan, and this dough is harder. Pan pizza is an American cuisine..</p>

                <h3>THIN</h3>
                <p>Thin crust pizza, such as New York style pizza dough, is much thinner, and usually the same width from the crust to the very edge of the pizza slices. This crust can be fired off very quickly; but because of the delicateness of the dough, they are also usually limited to one or two toppings. Some customers prefer this type of crust because of its crispy and crunchy texture.</p>

                <h3>STUFFED CRUST</h3>
                <p>Stuffed crust pizza is pizza with cheese or ingredients like sausages added to its outer crust. Stuffed pizza is pizza that typically has more cheese than ordinary pizzas. Before baking these pizzas, we generally add tomato sauce to the topping. Moreover, the crust of stuffed crust pizza is thicker since it contains ingredients in the crust.</p>

    <div class="ff"><h4>Pizza is an Italian food that was created in Italy (The Naples area). It is made with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings are cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil. These toppings are added over a piece of bread covered with sauce. The sauce is most often tomato-based, but butter-based sauces are used, too. The piece of bread is usually called a "pizza crust". Almost any kind of topping can be put over a pizza. The toppings used are different in different parts of the world. Pizza comes from Italy from Neapolitan cuisine. However, it has become popular in many parts of the world.</h4></div>
